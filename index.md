# What is this? 
One of the things that I have always felt is that finding easy to launch vulnerable machines is difficult. If you don't have a strong enough computer then you can't run them. This provides them already converted into AWS AMIs so that they can be quickly launched.

Overall this helps to take out the need to do Systems Administration and just focus on the gaining access to the system.
